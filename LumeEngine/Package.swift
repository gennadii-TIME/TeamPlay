// FFmpeg comes from a checksum-pinned xcframework attached to a GitHub release, so
// consuming this package requires nothing from build/ — SwiftPM just downloads it
// (PLAN.md §5).
//
// The artifact is versioned by the FFmpeg build it contains, not by the engine's
// release it happens to hang off: this URL only moves when build/versions.json, the
// configure flags, or the patch set change. Engine releases in between keep pointing
// at the same binary.
//
// A locally built xcframework wins when present, which is the development override —
// build/scripts/make-xcframework.sh writes exactly there, so anyone iterating on the
// FFmpeg build tests their own binary rather than silently linking the released one.
// Consumers never have that directory, so their resolution is unconditional.

// `-enable-library-evolution` is load-bearing, and it can only be expressed as an
// unsafe flag — this toolchain's SwiftSetting has no library-evolution option.
//
// Why it matters: with evolution, LumeEngineCore's module interface does not pull the
// CFFmpeg C module into a consumer's compile. Without it, an app that links LumeEngine
// *and* another FFmpeg-based engine compiles two conflicting definitions of the same C
// types and Clang refuses:
//
//     'AV_PIX_FMT_OHCODEC' from module 'CFFmpeg' is not present in definition of
//     'enum AVPixelFormat' in module 'Libavutil'
//
// That is precisely Lume's configuration (LumeEngine alongside KSPlayer/FFmpegKit), so
// dropping the flag broke it. Nesting the headers under lume_ffmpeg/ prevents header
// path collisions but cannot prevent C-namespace type redefinition.
//
// The catch: SwiftPM rejects unsafeFlags in any package resolved as a *versioned*
// dependency, which makes `.package(url:from:)` fail outright. So the flag is applied
// everywhere except there — path dependencies (Lume, and engine development) keep it,
// while version-resolved consumers go without.
//
// Consequence worth knowing: a consumer that adds this package by URL *and* links a
// second FFmpeg will hit the collision above. Such a consumer should vendor the package
// as a path/submodule dependency instead, which restores evolution. Revisit if SwiftPM
// ever exposes library evolution as a safe setting.
