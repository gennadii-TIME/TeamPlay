# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to coding agents (Claude Code and others) when working with code in this repository. `CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to it.

## What this is

LumeEngine is an FFmpeg 9-based media player engine for Apple platforms (iOS 18+, tvOS 18+, macOS 15+, visionOS 2+), built as a Swift 6 package for the Lume IPTV app. It is an original architecture designed around a stability doctrine: **PLAN.md is the authoritative design document** — §3 catalogs legacy-engine failure modes and the structural countermeasures that are hard requirements, §4 covers architecture decisions (D1–D9), §9 the roadmap. When making design decisions, check PLAN.md first.

## Relationship to Lume (`../Lume`)

The consumer app lives in the sibling repo `../Lume`. Most bug reports and feature requests arrive in Lume terms (channels, EPG, IPTV providers, engine fallback) — when triaging one, first decide whether it belongs in the engine or in the app, and read the relevant Lume code before changing engine behavior.

- Lume ships four engines behind an engine-priority fallback chain: LumeEngine (beta), KSPlayer, VLC, and AVPlayer. The LumeEngine integration code lives in `../Lume/Lume/Views/Player/` (`LumeEngineEngineView.swift`, `LumeEngineCoordinator.swift`, `LumeEngineControlsOverlay.swift`) — engine-side fixes go here, app-side wiring there.
- The consumer contract LumeEngine must satisfy (PLAN.md §2.1) is defined by `../Lume/Lume/Views/Player/` (`TVPlaybackEngine.swift`, `PlaybackClock.swift`, `PlaybackRetryController.swift`, the other `*EngineView.swift` implementations) and `../Lume/Lume/Services/Player/PlayableMedia.swift`.
- Division of responsibility: the engine reports typed errors/events and never retries on its own schedule — reconnect/backoff policy, engine fallback, and UI overlays are Lume's job.
- Lume has its own `AGENTS.md` (with a `CLAUDE.md` symlink); consult it when working on that side.
- Lume references this repo as a **local** SPM package at `../LumeEngine`, so uncommitted engine changes build straight into the app — and a Lume clone without a LumeEngine sibling (plus its FFmpeg xcframework) will not resolve. Both repos' contributor docs say so; keep them in sync.

## How FFmpeg reaches the build

`Package.swift` resolves the `CFFmpeg` binary target two ways, and the conditional is deliberate — don't "simplify" it away:

- `BinaryDependencies/FFmpeg.xcframework` exists → local `path:` binary target. This is the development override, so anyone iterating on `build/` tests their own FFmpeg.
- Otherwise → `binaryTarget(url:checksum:)` against the artifact attached to a GitHub release. Consumers (and a plain `git clone && swift build`) take this path and need nothing from `build/`.

The artifact URL is versioned by the FFmpeg build it contains, not by the engine release it hangs off: bump it only when `build/versions.json`, the configure flags, or the patch set change — and then in the same change as the pipeline edit, or consumers link a binary that doesn't match the source.

## Licensing (public repo)

Engine source is **MIT** (`LICENSE`). FFmpeg is linked under the **LGPL 2.1+**, and anything added under `build/patches/` modifies FFmpeg source and is therefore LGPL, not MIT. `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` is the single source of truth for what is linked and what downstream apps must do; update it in the same change whenever you touch `build/versions.json`, the configure flags in `build/scripts/build-ffmpeg.sh`, or the patch set. Two claims there are load-bearing and must stay true: the build is LGPL (`--disable-gpl --disable-nonfree`, no GPL external libs), and the `LumeEngine` product stays **dynamic** so FFmpeg remains relinkable.

## Commands

```bash
swift build
swift test                                    # full suite
swift test --filter TimestampUnwrapperTests   # one suite
swift test --filter DecoderTests/testName     # one test
swift run LumeEngineDemo                      # macOS demo app with diagnostics HUD
```

Prerequisites:
- `BinaryDependencies/FFmpeg.xcframework` must exist before anything compiles. Build it once (or after bumping `build/versions.json`):
  ```bash
  curl -sLo build/ffmpeg-9.0.1.tar.xz https://ffmpeg.org/releases/ffmpeg-9.0.1.tar.xz
  build/scripts/build-ffmpeg.sh macos-arm64    # one slice is enough for local dev
  build/scripts/make-xcframework.sh
  ```
- Tests need a host `ffmpeg` CLI (Homebrew) — fixtures are generated lazily on first test run by `Tests/LumeEngineCoreTests/Fixtures/generate-fixtures.sh` into `TestStreams/generated/` (gitignored, idempotent). `Fixtures.swift` finds Homebrew ffmpeg automatically; override with the `FFMPEG` env var.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) builds the macOS FFmpeg slice (cached on `build/versions.json` + scripts + patches hashes) and runs `swift test`, then cross-compiles the library for iOS and tvOS via `xcodebuild` (compile-only, one cached slice each — visionOS is left to local verification because that matrix entry was never confirmed on a runner — the xrOS SDK ships with Xcode, but a visionOS *destination* also needs Xcode's visionOS platform component); tagged releases build all 10 platform slices and attach the xcframework.

## Architecture

Three-layer target structure (`Package.swift`):

- **`CFFmpeg`** — binary target wrapping `BinaryDependencies/FFmpeg.xcframework` (FFmpeg 9.0.x static libs, LGPL config, built by `build/scripts/`).
- **`Sources/LumeEngineCore`** — the engine, no UI. Uses `internal import CFFmpeg` + library evolution so FFmpeg types never leak into consumers' compiles (apps can link other FFmpeg-based engines without symbol/module collisions — this is why the product is a **dynamic** library; don't change that). This is not theoretical: removing `-enable-library-evolution` broke Lume immediately, because it links FFmpegKit too and Clang then sees `enum AVPixelFormat` defined differently in `CFFmpeg` and `Libavutil`. Nesting the headers under `lume_ffmpeg/` stops header-path collisions but not C-namespace redefinition — evolution is what keeps `CFFmpeg` out of the consumer's compile.
- **The evolution flag is conditional in `Package.swift`** (`isVersionedDependency`, detected by `/checkouts/` in `#filePath`), because SwiftPM forbids `unsafeFlags` in version-resolved dependencies and there is no safe library-evolution setting. Path dependencies — Lume, its worktrees via the `LumeEngine` symlink, and engine development — get the flag; `.package(url:from:)` consumers don't, and such a consumer must not link a second FFmpeg (tell them to vendor by path instead). Don't collapse either conditional in that manifest.
- **`Sources/LumeEngine`** — public facade: `LumePlayer` (`@MainActor @Observable`), `LumePlayerView` (SwiftUI).

### Control plane vs data plane (PLAN.md D1)

This split is the core invariant of the codebase:

- **Control plane = actors.** `PlayerSession` (actor, `Session/`) owns lifecycle, seek, track switching, and event emission. It never touches frames.
- **Data plane = dedicated threads.** Blocking FFmpeg calls (`av_read_frame`, `avcodec_receive_frame`) run on their own threads: `Demuxer` → `VideoDecoder`/`AudioDecoder`/`SubtitleDecoder` → `SystemRenderer`. Stages communicate only through `Concurrency/Channel` — a bounded, blocking, PTS-accounted channel that provides backpressure (producers park when full) and wakeable teardown. Never put a blocking FFmpeg call on an actor; never bypass channels between stages.
- **The main thread is never on the data path.** UI state is a decoupled low-rate observation.

### Key invariants (from PLAN.md §3 — requirements, not style preferences)

- **Session epochs:** a `PlayerSession` opens exactly one URL; a new URL is a new session object. There is no rebuild-in-place, ever. Teardown joins data-plane threads before `avformat_close_input`.
- **Timestamp unwrapping at the demux boundary:** `Time/TimestampUnwrapper` normalizes all PTS/DTS to monotonic 64-bit engine time immediately after `av_read_frame` (handles MPEG-TS 33-bit wraparound). Nothing downstream ever sees raw container time.
- **RAII FFI wrappers:** `FFI/Packet`, `FFI/Frame` etc. wrap `AVPacket*`/`AVFrame*` with deinit-based free. `@unchecked Sendable` is allowed **only** on these audited immutable-after-construction wrappers and on `Channel` — never on state-bearing types. No `Unmanaged` outside FFI.
- **A/V sync is Apple's job:** decoded frames are enqueued into `AVSampleBufferRenderSynchronizer` (`Render/SystemRenderer`). Do not add drop-frame heuristics or hand-rolled clocks.
- **Deinterlacing never costs the hardware decoder.** `Decode/VideoFilterGraph` (bwdif, falling back to yadif) sits between `avcodec_receive_frame` and delivery; VideoToolbox frames are downloaded with `av_hwframe_transfer_data` and filtered on the CPU. Do *not* "simplify" this into switching the codec to software when a stream is interlaced: that costs a mid-stream codec rebuild and keyframe resync at every interlaced/progressive splice, which live broadcasts (ad breaks in a 1080i match) are full of. Engagement is decided per frame from `AV_FRAME_FLAG_INTERLACED` (PLAN.md §3, failure 6) and, once engaged, everything stays on one path — `deint=interlaced` passes progressive frames through. Filter output carries the sink's time base, which a field-doubling filter *halves*; PTS and durations are rescaled back to engine µs in `VideoDecoder`.
- **Zero global mutable state:** all configuration is `PlayerConfiguration` passed at session creation. No `static var` knobs.
- **No force unwraps / `as!` / `fatalError` in engine paths**; failures return typed `EngineError`. No `assertionFailure` in production channel/data paths — misuse degrades, never crashes.
- **Never scrape FFmpeg log strings for control flow** (`av_log` is diagnostics only). Silence is never a failure mode: pipelines are supervised, stalls are detected from playhead ground truth, and failures surface as typed `PlayerEvent`s on the session's `AsyncStream`.
- Swift 6 strict concurrency (`swiftLanguageModes: [.v6]`) — keep it honest, don't suppress diagnostics.

### Tests

`Tests/LumeEngineCoreTests/` covers the historically crash-prone areas by design: timestamp wraparound (against a real wrap-seam fixture `wrap.ts`), channel backpressure/teardown, fixture-based decode, deinterlacing (against a field-coded `interlaced.ts`), playback, and resilience via `Support/TortureHTTPServer.swift` (a fault-injecting local HTTP server — mid-stream errors, stalls, disconnects). New work in demux/decode/time/concurrency should come with tests here; add new media fixtures to `generate-fixtures.sh`, not as committed binaries.
